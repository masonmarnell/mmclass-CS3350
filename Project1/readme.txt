An exerpt from the project description:

Please develop a RISC-V code fragment called extract_fields procedure that takes two arguments. The first argument (a0) is a given 32-bit R-type instruction. The second argument (a1) is an integer number with one of the following values: 0, or 1, or 2. The procedure performs the following functionality: 
•	if the second argument is 0, the procedure returns the opcode field of the given instruction in the first argument (a0); 
•	if the second argument is 1, the procedure returns the rd field of the given instruction;
•	if the second argument is 2, the procedure returns the rs1 field of the given instruction.
